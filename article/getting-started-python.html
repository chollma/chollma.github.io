        <p>Whether you're a software engineer, data scientist, or just someone who wants to make tediuous tasks easy, Python might be the programming language you've been dreaming of. I recently started investigating the language and I have to say that I'm impressed. It's remarkably easy to get rolling (especially if you're on a Mac) and I was amazed by all the things I could use Python to do.</p>
        <p>In the article to follow, we'll walk through setting up Python on your machine, the problem I solved for my own workflow by building a program to parse HTML, and some helpful reading if you want to take your learning a step further.</p>
        <p>Before we get started, I want to note that Python and the program we'll build can make it very easy to extract content from a webpage (which was my goal). I recommend parsing code that you own or have express permission to access. Don't go violating terms of service agreements or stealing the property of others. Be a good citizen of the web.</p>
        <p>Now that we've got the ethics out of the way, let's help access Python and all the goodness it has to offer.</p>
        <h2>Installing Python</h2>
        <p>Everything to follow in this article will require Python v3.0 or higher.</p>
        <p>If you're on a Mac, you're in luck. Python comes preinstalled on your computer, but we'll want to make sure you're running the most up-to-date version. Head on over to the downloads section on Python.org and find the most recent stable release (at the time of this writing, we're on version 3.7.9). You'll want the "macOS 64-bit installer".</p>
        <p>If you're on a PC, that's okay too. Select "Windows" in the download selection and find the latest stable release of Python. You'll want the "x86 Executable Installer".</p>
        <p>If you're running some different operating system, there's some additional options for you here: https://www.python.org/downloads/</p>
        <h2>The Moving Parts</h2>
        <p>The software you've just installed on your computer is what's called an Integrated Development Environment or IDE. This is a set of tools that make a developer's job easier. In our case, the Python IDE comes with 2 different tools - an interactive shell and a file editor. We'll be using both to build our HTML parser.  </p>
        <h3>The Integrated Development Environment</h3>
        <h4>The Interactive Shell</h4>
        <p>Think of this kind of like a calculator. You can punch stuff in on-demand and get back a response quickly. The interactive shell will allow you to run code that you write, 1 item at a time. This shell is also where you'll be able to see the outputs from the program that we'll be building.</p>
        <h4>The File Editor</h4>
        <p>The file editor contains all the code that you'll need to run your complete program. It will include a detailed list of instructions that you'll be giving to the computer to run with but it's not interactive like the interactive shell. Anything you write in the file editor must be saved and then run.</p>
        <h2>The Key Principles</h2>
        <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
        <h3>Else if statements</h3>
        <h3>If statements</h3>
        <h3>Import()</h3>
        <h3>Input()</h3>
        <h3>Len()</h3>
        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <h3>Lower()</h3>
        <h3>Print()</h3>
        <h3>Str()</h3>
