        <p>Whether you're a software engineer, data scientist, or just someone who wants to make tediuous tasks easy, Python might be the programming language you've been dreaming of. I recently started investigating the language and I have to say that I'm impressed. It's remarkably easy to get rolling (especially if you're on a Mac) and I was amazed by all the things I could use Python to do.</p>
        <p>In the article to follow, we'll walk through setting up Python on your machine, the problem I solved for my own workflow by building a program to parse HTML, and some helpful reading if you want to take your learning a step further.</p>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>the program we are about to build can make it very easy to extract content from a webpage. It is important that we are "good citizens of the web" and parse only information that we own or have permission to access.</p>
        <p>Now that we've got the ethics out of the way, let's help access Python and all the goodness it has to offer.</p>
        <h2>Installing Python</h2>
        <p>Before we start writing code, it is important to pick a good text editor. This tutorial will make use of the out-of-the-box file editor that Python gives us, but there's a ton of other great options such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">PyCharm</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio Code</a></p>
        <p>One of the reasons I have loved working in Python is because of how easy it is for someone who has never coded before to get set-up for the first time.</p>
        <p><strong>If you're on a Mac:</strong><br> Browse to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">Mac OS X downloads section</a> and find the most recent stable release (at the time of this writing, we're on version 3.7.9). You'll want the "macOS 64-bit installer".</p>
        <p><strong>If you're on a PC:</strong><br>  Browse to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Windows downloads section</a> and find the latest stable release of Python. You'll want the "x86 Executable Installer".</p>
        <p><strong>If you're running some different operating system:</strong> <br>Don't worry. There's a <a href="https://www.python.org/download/other/">downloads section</a> for you too.</p>
        <h2>The Moving Parts</h2>
        <p>The software you've just installed on your computer is what's called an Integrated Development Environment or IDE. This is a set of tools that make a developer's job easier. In our case, the Python IDE comes with 2 different tools - an interactive shell and a file editor. We'll be using both to build our HTML parser.  </p>
        <h3>The Integrated Development Environment</h3>
        <h4>The Interactive Shell</h4>
        <p>Think of this kind of like a calculator. You can punch stuff in on-demand and get back a response quickly. The interactive shell will allow you to run code that you write, 1 item at a time. This shell is also where you'll be able to see the outputs from the program that we'll be building.</p>
        <h4>The File Editor</h4>
        <p>The file editor contains all the code that you'll need to run your complete program. It will include a detailed list of instructions that you'll be giving to the computer to run with but it's not interactive like the interactive shell. Anything you write in the file editor must be saved and then run.</p>
        <h2>The Key Principles</h2>
        <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
        <p>These work similar in Python to how they did in your highschool english class. A dictionary in Python is a data structure that contains an unordered list of values. We can access the data in this dictionary by referring to it's "key". In the program we're building, we'll build a dictionary to select specific elements in the HTML. I will admit, this wasn't my first approach to the code, but I went back and found that using a dictionary drastically cut down on the code I had to repeat. </p>
        <h3>Else if statements</h3>
        <p>Abbreviated as elif in our code, these statements allow us to test if a condition is true or false when there are multiple potential cases possible. We'll use these heavily in our example to follow.</p>
        <h3>If statements</h3>
        <p>We use if statements to decide whether to run a block of code or skip over it.</p>
        <h3>Import()</h3>
        <p>Sometimes someone has already developed an elegant solution to a problem so we don't have to. We use the import statement at the begining of a program to add additional functionality that we want to use later in the program.</p>
        <h3>Input()</h3>
        <p>This function prompts the user for keyword input.</p>
        <h3>Len()</h3>
        <p>This function returns the number of items in the object it's called on.</p>
        <h3>Libraries</h3>
        <p>Libraries are common in any programming language. These are reusable snippets of code that we'll use to perform complex actions. Other developers have built out useful functionality that is has many uses and can be applied to different problems.</p>
        <h3>Lower()</h3>
        <p>This method returns a lowercased string</p>
        <h3>Print()</h3>
        <p>This method is used for printing data or a message to the screen. When we use this method in our program, it'll display our text in the interactive shell.</p>
        <h3>Str()</h3>
        <p>This method returns a string of the contained object.</p>
