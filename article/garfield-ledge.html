        <p>One of the reasons I love living in Washington is living near views like this one. Last weekend, we ventured out for a hike in the Middle Fork. If you're unfamiliar with the area, this is part of Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.</p>
        <p>With the pandemic still a real concern, we were looking for something out of the way, with limited foot traffic. Hiking and camping seems to be one of only a few activities we can do these days, but I’m not complaining. I live for the fresh air,
            vibrant green foliage, and the looks of satisfaction on the faces of my canine companions.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Northwest is a unique place. Mountains aren’t a foreign phenomenon, but the climate here is something special. In the span of an hour, a person can be at the beach on the ocean and then in the midst of the towering trees of a temperate
            rainforest. This hike was abundant with native green fauna. Lucky for me, I was with my wife, who surprises me every day identifying a plant I haven’t heard of.</p>
        <p>As with any hike we embark on, we took the opportunity to get some “zoomies” out by bringing our pups. They’re the perfect (well almost) adventurers and it brings me joy to see how excited they get when they know we’re headed somewhere with new
            smells and views. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, they were ready to roll, panting heavily and jumping around in the backseat.</p>
        <p>With an elevation gain of about 830 ft in 1.8 miles (that’s about 17% grade), the hike up the Garfield Ledges trail doesn’t start out easy. This didn’t seem to bother Mocha or Mia, but I know I was happy thinking that the picturesque view we were
            seeking wasn’t too far away. If you’ve hiked in Washington before you know that once of the most distinct features of these trails is the abundance of ferns. They’re everywhere, covering the ground with the same density you’d see as beds of
            pine needles in The Rockies.</p>
