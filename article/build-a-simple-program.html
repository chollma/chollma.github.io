        <p class="article-note">This article is the sequel to <a href="https://cooperhollmaier.com/article/getting-started-python">Getting Started with Python.</a></p>
        <p>In the last article, I walked you through setting up Python on your machine, the inner workings of an Integrated Developement Environment (IDE), and left you with some helpful methods that we'll use to build a working program in Python.</p>
        <p>Let's get started.</p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>Everytime I'm working on a new project, I like to document what I'm doing and why I'm doing it, so I can organize my thoughts and look back at it later. It may be a little extra work, but you'll thank yourself when you're building the next cool
            thing and you've already done some of the work.</p>
        <h3>Why are we building this?</h3>
        <p>The goal for this project is to write an application in Python that will request a website, parse its HTML source code and run a series of tests against it. While I could review the code by hand, developing a python application to do it for me
            will make the process faster.</p>
        <h3>What technology are we using?</h3>
        <p>We're going to use the out-of-the-box Python IDE (v.3.7.9). We'll be writing a series of instructions via the File Editor that will run in the Python Shell. Rather than only use built-in functions, we'll make use of some libraries &#8212; <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a>            and
            <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a>. These libraries will make our work easier and we'll end up having to write fewer lines of code.</p>
        <h3>What was the thought process?</h3>
        <p>Building each blog post on this website is a very manual process. Every time I want to publish a new post, I build the page from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p> To ensure I have all the boilerplate elements that I need (navigation, name, date, h1, etc.), I have to review the code I've written line-by-line. I want to automate this process so that I can spend more time writing and less time checking.</p>
        <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
        <p>It's okay to get your ideas down in code and then refactor.</p>
        <p>I built the original version of this program with a couple hundred more lines of messy code. Then I discovered dictionaries and it made this the code cleaner to read, and easier to work with. </p>
        <h2>Setting Up the File</h2>
        <p>Now that we've spent some time documenting our process and thinking about our goal, let's get down to coding.</p>
        <p>The first thing that we're going to need to do is to open up the Python Shell and create a new file in the File Editor. In this blank file editor window is where we are going to write our first Python application.</p>
        <p>The first two lines of code we're going to write are import statements. These will bring in the two libraries we're going to need to request a webpage from a server and parse it's HTML source code.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/f366876617a64fcbc0737f3be2162b22.js"></script>
        <p>You might notice that if you try and save and run this program now, it won't work. This is because we haven't installed the libraries we'll need on your machine. Let's do that now.</p>
        <p><strong>If you're on a Mac:</strong><br>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>If you're on Windows:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open up Command Prompt</li>
                    <li>Type "cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Python37-32\Scripts" and press Enter
                        <li>Type "pip install requests" and press Enter</li>
                        <li>Once the requests library is installed, we'll want to install Beautiful Soup</li>
                        <li>Type "pip install bs4" and press Enter</li>
                        <li>Once the installation finishes, we can go back to the file editor.</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now that we've got the libraries we'll need for our project installed, let's add a few more lines to the top of the file. These are purely cosmetic.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/eb664766cc205f5419dfa2e52de3ef41.js"></script>
                <p>One more quick addition and we'll start parsing some code on the webpage of our choice. Let's add a variable called "url" that we'll pass user input to. This will allow us to dynamically change the URL we're testing.</p>
                <p>If you're following along, you should now have the following code written:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/48044f25b778e603d2be959718c46cef.js"></script>
                <h2>Parsing the Document</h2>
                <p>So far in our program, we've told the computer:
                    <ul>
                        <li>we'd like to import and use two libraries (Requests and Beautiful Soup)</li>
                        <li>we'd like to print out some introductory statements to help the user know the program is running </li>
                        <li> we'd like to prompt the user for a URL, which we'll assign as a string to a variable, "url"</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Next, we're going to need to create a variable to store the page we're requesting with the Requests library and a variable to store our parsed HTML from Beautiful Soup. I decided to name these in an obvious fashion.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/c0321fc651827880e7f35275231d0e4b.js"></script>
                <p>Now it'd be silly if we stopped here. If you wanted to look at the source code of a particular webpage, you could have easily done this with your browser. You didn't need Python to get this far.</p>
                <p>If you've gotten this far, I assume that you're looking to parse a webpage for <em>specific elements</em>. Let's set-up the next part of the program to allow you to parse to your hearts desire. We'll be building a dictionary with all the
                    things you want to find.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/b6efb3594ec1072ac60518ab1b73003a.js"></script>
                <p>Let's start with a few simple dictionary definitions (we'll add some more later). If you add a print statement to the end of your program and run it, here's what you should get.
                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/063c0e616aade4bfd3f6fa02948b360b.js"></script>
                    <h3>Output</h3>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/chollma/8d5b2982524390a97daae33a2d168970.js"></script>
                </p>
                <p>If your program is functioning the same way as mine is, you've done it. You've created a functional program that takes a URL, executes an HTTP request, parses the HTML that comes back and prints out the HTTP response code and the title
                    of the page.</p>
                <p>If you're like me though, you've seen the possibilities and now you're hungry for more. The reason I intially came up with this program was to look at a page on this blog and make sure that it met my own quality guidelines. Let's define
                    some conditions that we want to be true and then build some tests in Python to check if they are on our test page.</p>
                <h2>Running the Tests</h2>
                <h2>Interpretting the Results</h2>
                <h2>Homework</h2>
