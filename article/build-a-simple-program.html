        <p class="article-note">This article is the sequel to <a href="https://cooperhollmaier.com/article/getting-started-python">Getting Started with Python.</a></p>
        <p>In the last article, I walked you through setting up Python on your machine, the inner workings of an Integrated Developement Environment (IDE), and left you with some helpful methods that we'll use to build a working program in Python.</p>
        <p>Let's get started.</p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>Everytime I'm working on a new project, I like to document what I'm doing and why I'm doing it, so I can organize my thoughts and look back at it later. It may be a little extra work, but you'll thank yourself when you're building the next cool
            thing and you've already done some of the work.</p>
        <h3>Why are we building this?</h3>
        <p>The goal for this project is to write an application in Python that will request a website, parse its HTML source code and run a series of tests against it. While I could review the code by hand, developing a python application to do it for me
            will make the process faster.</p>
        <h3>What technology are we using?</h3>
        <p>We're going to use the out-of-the-box Python IDE (v.3.7.9). We'll be writing a series of instructions via the File Editor that will run in the Python Shell. Rather than only use built-in functions, we'll make use of some libraries &#8212; <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a>            and
            <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a>. These libraries will make our work easier and we'll end up having to write fewer lines of code.</p>
        <h3>What was the thought process?</h3>
        <p>Building each blog post on this website is a very manual process. Every time I want to publish a new post, I build the page from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p> To ensure I have all the boilerplate elements that I need (navigation, name, date, h1, etc.), I have to review the code I've written line-by-line. I want to automate this process so that I can spend more time writing and less time checking.</p>
        <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
        <p>It's okay to get your ideas down in code and then refactor.</p>
        <p>I built the original version of this program with a couple hundred more lines of messy code. Then I discovered dictionaries and it made this the code cleaner to read, and easier to work with. </p>
        <h2>Setting Up the File</h2>
        <p>Now that we've spent some time documenting our process and thinking about our goal, let's get down to coding.</p>
        <p>The first thing that we're going to need to do is to open up the Python Shell and create a new file in the File Editor.</p>
        <h2>Parsing the Document</h2>
        <h2>Running the Tests</h2>
        <h2>Interpretting the Results</h2>
        <h2>Homework</h2>
