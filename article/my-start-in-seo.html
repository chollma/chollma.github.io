        <p>In light of the public health crisis all of us are experiencing, the internships that many journalism and communications students need to graduate have all but dried up. As businesses across the nation struggle to keep their doors open, hiring
            freezes are running rampant in an effort to curb costs.</p>
        <p> Schools around the country (including my own alma mater) have shifted students to a self-study model, in which students are on their own to acquire critical skills they'll need to be successful in the modern workplace. As a result, I've offered
            to mentor one such student as they aspire to work as an in-house SEO. They remainder of this article is inspired by the brilliant questions I've been asked by someone just dipping their toes in the shallow end of <em>search engine optimization</em>.</p>
        <h2>My Story: How Failure Led Me Here</h2>
        <p>Whether it was building a better wagon for my paper route as a kid, volunteering eagerly to be berated by angry theme park guests, or starting a volunteer organization on campus â€” I've always wanted to build things, solve tough problems, and help people.  
        </p>
        <p>This drive let me to pursue a degree in Electric Engineering. I was, at that point in my life, intent on solving the global consumption crisis with renewable energy. It wasn't two semesters before I started falling behind. I went from being a "gifted" student and an honors student in high school to academic probation. I took Calculus 2 three different times before deciding that a change was in order. The "weed out" classes were successfully weeding me out. But it wasn't because I was <em>distracted</em>.  </p>
