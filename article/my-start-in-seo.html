        <p>In light of the public health crisis all of us are experiencing, the internships that many journalism and communications students need to graduate have all but dried up. As businesses across the nation struggle to keep their doors open, hiring
            freezes are running rampant in an effort to curb costs.</p>
        <p> Schools around the country (including my own alma mater) have shifted students to a self-study model, in which students are on their own to acquire critical skills they'll need to be successful in the modern workplace. As a result, I've offered
            to mentor one such student as they aspire to work as an in-house SEO. They remainder of this article is inspired by the brilliant questions I've been asked by someone just dipping their toes in the shallow end of <em>search engine optimization</em>.</p>
        <h2>My Story: How Failure Led Me Here</h2>
        <p>Whether it was building a better wagon for my paper route as a kid, volunteering eagerly to be berated by angry theme park guests, or starting a volunteer organization on campus â€” I've always wanted to build things, solve tough problems, and help people.  
        </p>
        <p>This drive let me to pursue a degree in Electric Engineering. I was, at that point in my life, intent on solving the global consumption crisis with renewable energy. </p>
        <h3>Failure #1: Choosing the wrong passion</h3>    
        <p>It wasn't two semesters before I started falling behind. I went from being a "gifted" student and an honors student in high school to academic probation. I took Calculus 2 three different times before deciding that a change was in order. The "weed out" classes were successfully weeding me out. But it wasn't because I was incapable of the work.  </p>
        <p>I was <em>distracted</em>.</p>
        <p>I wanted to the work I was doing to matter. I shifted focus and started working on a degree in journalism. I never had an intention of becoming a journalist in the traditional sense but the work I was failing at seemed constructed in the last century, not cutting edge.</p>
        <p>It's funny, looking back 5 years later, the single most impactful moment that I remember was my freshman year orientation class for engineering students. I remember the professor saying, "The best thing I can teach out isn't about engineering, but to unlock a love of life-long learning." </p>
        <p>This stuck with me over the next few semesters. I went from drowning in lab reports and math assignments, to exploring everything I could get my hands on. After switching degrees, I went on to work the overnight (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) public radio station (yes, I still cannot get enough of NPR radio) and running the digital presses at a print shop in the next town over.   </p>
        <h3>Failure #1: Showing up late</h3>
        <p>Before you get comfortable and assume the <em>happily ever after</em>  to this fairytale, I failed again. This time, I  </p>
