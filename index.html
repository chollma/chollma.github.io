        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Cooper Hollmaier</strong>. I'm a people-first leader with a passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible for all.
            <p>Currently, I work with a talented team to support the technical search engine optimization (SEO) of REI's (<a href="https://www.rei.com ">Recreational Equipment, Inc.</a>) digital properties. Prior to coming in-house, I worked agency-side
                with brands including BarkShop, Gerber Childrenswear, Plant Therapy, and A.T. Cross.</p>
            <p>When I'm not in the office, you'll find me embracing the outdoors. I'm an avid mountain biker, runner, and am always up for the next adventure.</p>
            <p>Want to connect? Please don't hesitate to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/cooperhollmaier " aria-label="Go to Cooper Hollmaier 's twitter profile page">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:cooperjhollmaier@gmail.com" aria-label="Open an email to compose to Cooper Hollmaier">email me</a>.</p>
            <h2>What I'm Reading</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How to Survive a Plague: The Inside Story of How Citizens and Science Tamed AIDS - David France</li>
                <li>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History - Elizabeth Kolbert</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>What Others Have Said</h2>
            <p>"Few people can take a subject as shrouded in ambiguity as SEO and make it seem clear, understandable, and approachable, but that's the kind of horsepower Cooper brings to the table. His deep and thorough understanding of SEO concepts and
                principles helps him provide fast and meaningful feedback when called upon. Cooper's general intellect is evident as well; he quickly learns and understands the web systems in his orbit, and uses that knowledge to collaborate on technical
                solutions. Any team would count themselves lucky to work with such an expedient and reliable contributor."<br> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviduffy/">David Duffy</a>, Sr. Frontend Developer at REI</p>
            <p>"There's so much to say about Cooper, but I think the three most important things are that he's crazy smart, so driven it inspires me to work harder, and one of the most collaborative teammates I've ever had. In a world where people want to
                put their heads down and get the job done, Cooper is doing his own stellar work and then pushing the company and the team toward the future of SEO. He's building trainings, sharing new ideas, and creating new, more efficient ways of getting
                the job done. He's hopping in brainstorms, building topic lists, and answering questions--even if it means he goes home late. Cooper works tirelessly for the work that he believes in, and he's always there to help his team do the same.
                He's hands down one of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to work with, and most importantly, he's just a great guy. If he's on your team, count yourself lucky."<br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-petrie/">Sarah Petrie</a>,
                Content Marketing Manager at Tallo </p>
            <p>"Cooper is one of the most talented marketers and problem solvers I've had the privilege of sharing an office with. From his first day, Cooper had a drive to learn, willingness to roll up his sleeves, and the focus to tackle projects solo
                or with a group. His SEO skills and technical knowhow were a tremendous asset in driving results for our larger clients and his work was played a formative role in the development of the Enterprise Accounts team I led. Additionally, Cooper's
                client handling and communication abilities directly contributed to saving more than 1 client and keeping revenue that was all but lost. His skills and expertise are an immediate value add within any team or organization."<br> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj-enoch-0801188a/">BJ Enoch</a>,
