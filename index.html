    <p>Few people can take a subject as shrouded in ambiguity as SEO and make it seem clear, understandable, and
        approachable, but that's the kind of horsepower Cooper brings to the table. His deep and thorough understanding
        of SEO concepts and principles helps him provide fast and meaningful feedback when called upon. Cooper's general
        intellect is evident as well; he quickly learns and understands the web systems in his orbit, and uses that
        knowledge to collaborate on technical solutions. Any team would count themselves lucky to work with such an
        expedient and reliable contributor.</p>
    <h3>BJ Enoch</h3>
    <p>Cooper is one of the most talented marketers and problem solvers I've had the privilege of sharing an office
        with. From his first day, Cooper had a drive to learn, willingness to roll up his sleeves, and the focus to
        tackle projects solo or with a group. His SEO skills and technical knowhow were a tremendous asset in driving
        results for our larger clients and his work was played a formative role in the development of the Enterprise
        Accounts team I led. Additionally, Cooper's client handling and communication abilities directly contributed to
        saving more than 1 client and keeping revenue that was all but lost. His skills and expertise are an immediate
        value add within any team or organization.</p>
    <h3>Sarah Petrie</h3>
    <p>There's so much to say about Cooper, but I think the three most important things are that he's crazy smart, so
        driven it inspires me to work harder, and one of the most collaborative teammates I've ever had. In a world
        where people want to put their heads down and get the job done, Cooper is doing his own stellar work and then
        pushing the company and the team toward the future of SEO. He's building trainings, sharing new ideas, and
        creating new, more efficient ways of getting the job done. He's hopping in brainstorms, building topic lists,
        and answering questions--even if it means he goes home late. Cooper works tirelessly for the work that he
        believes in, and he's always there to help his team do the same. He's hands down one of the best people I've
        ever had the pleasure to work with, and most importantly, he's just a great guy. If he's on your team, count
        yourself lucky.</p>
    <h3>Caitlin Shannon</h3>
    <p>Cooper is an exceptionally talented, friendly, and driven marketing professional. While I haven't had the
        pleasure of working with him within the same company, I've worked on many projects with him as a freelance
        graphic designer. He is an enthusiastic advocate for those he believes in and has continued to be one of my
        greatest supporters as I've taken my own design business full-time. He leads his projects well, with the utmost
        respect and professionalism. He is down to earth, approachable, and carries his expertise with grace. I would
        trust any of my precious clients with him without a moment of hesitation, and that says a lot. I could not give
        a higher recommendation. Any company would be blessed to have him!</p>
    <h3>Sara Brace</h3>
    <p>It's rare that you come across unprecedented talent like Cooper. As a Social Media Specialist at SocialSEO, I've
        had the opportunity to work with Cooper on several accounts and projects. With a creative AND analytical
        mindset, Cooper is a remarkable resource regarding topics on SEO and beyond, as he is undoubtedly well-rounded
        in his skillset. Cooper's evident eagerness to learn and excel shows that he's always ready to take on a
        challenge. As a dependable employee, he is always ready to help his teammates and superiors to bring clients
        success. I'm happy I had the chance to work alongside Cooper with joint accounts and hope we get to work
        together again in the future.</p>
